          <p>Manufacturers and companies around the world feel great pleasure when creating their environmentally friendly products and they make it their mission and objective to share their progress and joy with the rest of the world in hopes that we can all come together and protect the earth from danger. The benefits of products of this type are great in number. A few of them are mentioned below.</p>

                  <h3>Reduced Costs</h3>
                  <p>The cost required to produce Eco-Friendly goods and products is much lower than the cost of producing other types of products, primarily because everything needed to create an Eco-Friendly product already exists and is readily available without any synthetic materials being required, therefore resulting in lower costs of production.</p>

                  <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                  <p>As all of these products are either recyclable, reusable or biodegradable, they can be given back to the earth once they have been used, resulting in allowing the earth to replenish its natural nutrients.

                  <h3>Reduced Pollution</h3>
                  <p>Using earth's natural resources sustainably removes the need for large factories which operate using fossil fuels as there are many other forms of "green" energy, therefore, using and promoting these products would lead to a smaller need for large-scale fossil-fuel-consuming factories, thus meaning less pollution overall. </p>
