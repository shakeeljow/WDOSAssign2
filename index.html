                  <h3>Energy</h3>
                  <p>The creation of electricity has by far the worst effect on pollution due to the burning of fossil fuels which release harmful gases into the atmosphere.</p>
                  <p>Sources of renewable energy, such as:</p>
                  <!-- numbered list -->
                  <ol>
                    <li>Wind Energy</li>
                    <li>Solar Energy</li>
                    <li>Hydro-electricity</li>
                </ol>
